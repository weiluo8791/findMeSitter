Find me a Day Care App

I would like to do a Day Care matching App

As a parents often comes a time we need to find a suitable day care for our kids. Finding a reliable and dependable good day care is a very difficult task and often parents rely on reference from other people they know to pick their day care.

I would like to write an application that not only take detail from day care provider but also allow other parent to write review or reference for the particular day care. This also should include a search front end that would allow parents search criteria and match day care with recommendation.

I would imagine the application will contains 2 different data set one from Day Care provider to enter their detail (fee, address, etc) and the other for parents review. Then a search front for all user to search both data set.
